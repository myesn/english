## 1. 否定句

功能：说不

构成：is not/ am not/ are not （简单说，就是在 is、am、are 后加上 not 就可以表示否定句）

例子：
| 肯定句 | 否定句 |
| - | - |
| This is my name. | This is not my name. |
| I am Venus. | I am not Venus. |
| You are my friend. | You are not my friend. |
| She is pretty(漂亮的/好看的). | She is not pretty. |

这不是我的车：This is not my car.

我不是老师：I am not a teacher.

not 和 is、am、are 连接时的缩略形式：
  1. is not = isn't
      
      She is not here. =  She isn't here. 她不在这里。

  2. am not = 'm not

      I am not Linda. = I'm not Linda. 我不是琳达。
